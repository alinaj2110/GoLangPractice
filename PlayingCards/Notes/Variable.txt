• Variable declaration
    ○ var - Variable keyword
    ○ var nameofvariable typeofvariable = valueofvariable
    ○ Ex: var card string = "Ace of Spades"
    ○ Go is a static type language ( explicit declaration of the types)
    ○ MUST declare type of variable
    ○ Fundamental types:
        § bool
        § string
        § int
        § float64
    ○ Alternate method:
        § variablename := valueofvariable
        § Go automatically infers the type
        § := only applies if a new variable is created, not during reassigning
    ○ CANNOT be initialized outside a function body
    ○ Can also declare a variable and later initialize it  
    ○ CAN declare a variable outside a function before initializing within
