• Custom Type
    ○ Give a custom name to a type that we declare
    ○ ex: type typename [] string

• Receiver for a Function
    ○ sets methods on the variables that we create
    ○ func (recname variabletype) funcname(listofargs) returntype {
        Body of function
      }
    ○ recname contains the actual copy of the variable that can be used within the function
    ○ variabletype declares that all the variables of this type can call the function on itself
    ○ doesn't use keywords like this and self to call upon itself, needs a recname mandatorily
    ○ Conventions demand usage of few letter names as recname (abbreviated forms)

• Subset of a slice
    ○ slicename[includedstartindex : excludedendindex ]
    ○ slicename[: excludedindex]  -- from start of the slice to the mentioned index
    ○ slicename[includedindex : ] -- from included index to end of the slice

• Function with multiple return values
    ○ func fname(args) (returntype1, returntype2, ...) {
        Body of the function
      }

• Note: if x is a string type variable, then string(x) does not throw an error
