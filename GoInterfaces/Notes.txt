* Interface
    * Helps in reusability of code
    * type iname interface {
        member functions
        .
        .
        .
      }
    * if another type in the program has the member function returning same type specified in the interface, then it is an honourary member of the interface
    * the member functions must have types of arguments and return type
    * Not a generic type
    * are implicit, i.e. we dont have to manually mention a struct is of that interface but we should ensure our struct has all those specified member functions
    *
