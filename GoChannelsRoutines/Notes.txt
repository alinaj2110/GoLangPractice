* Concurrent Programming
    * go funcname()
    * creates a new thread to run the funcname()
    * Go scheduler to coordinate the working of the go routines 
    * Main routines and Child routines
    
* Channels
    * intermediate communication channel between routines
    * data in a channel must all be of same type
    * channelname := make(chan datatype)
    * channelname <- value      //sends value as data to the channel
    * varname <- channelname    //receive a value through the channel and assign it to variable
    * fname(<-channelname)      //directly passes the value obtained into the function call

* Blocking Channels
    * main routine waits when receiving from channel

* Function Literals
    * like lambda function/anonymous function for go
    * func (arglist) {}
